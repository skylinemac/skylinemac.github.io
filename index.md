# What is SMAC?
> What is the point of learning math?

Middle school math curriculum--and even competition math (think AMC, MATHCOUNTS...)--is filled with memorizing formula and solving problems that often seem entirely abstract. As such, learning math is frequently seen as a pointless task for many kids. 

However, in our own high school careers, being exposed to the beauty of higher math and seeing the subject being applied everywhere in our lives has helped us realize: it isn't math itself that is boring, it is the way it has been introduced. Hence, with the **Skyline Mathematical Applications Contest (SMAC)**, we've taken a different approach:

The SMAC's questions focus on introducing math's real-world applications, using previously abstract concepts and applying them to everything from engineering/physics to buying the best-valued donut. Much like the problem sets found in college math, competitors will **discover and derive** new concepts and learn new things, rather than being simply told that these concepts exist. Of course, with the engaging competition format and a healthy dose of humor sprinkled throughout our questions, our ultimate hope is that students have fun and learn that there _is a point to learning math_.

**Interested in registering?** Our contest this year will be held on **Friday, February 27!** Use the link at the side or top (for mobile users) of this website to fill out a form. All other information and updates will then be communicated to you via email. _Please note that this competition is entirely individual, no need to form teams!_
