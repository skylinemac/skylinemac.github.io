# What is SMAC?
> What is the point of learning math?

Middle school math curriculum--and even competition math (think AMC, MATHCOUNTS...)--is filled with memorizing formula and solving problems that often seem entirely abstract. As such, learning math is frequently seen as a pointless task for many kids. 

However, in our own high school careers, being exposed to the beauty of higher math and seeing the subject being applied everywhere in our lives has helped us realized: it isn't math itself that is boring, it is the way it has been introduced. Hence, with the **Skyline Math Applications Contest (SMAC)**, we've taken a different approach:

The SMAC's questions focus on introducing math's real world applications, using previously abstract concepts and applying them to everything from engineering/physics to buying the best-valued donut. Much like the problem sets found in college math, competitors will **discover and derive** new concepts and learn new things, rather than being simply told that these concepts exist. Of course, with the engaging competition format and a healthy dose of humor sprinkled throughout our questions, our ultimate hope is that students have fun and learn that there _is a point to learning math_.

# Competition Logistics
### Location
**The SMAC will be held at** <span style="color:blue"><b>Skyline High School</b></span> **on** Friday <span style="color:blue"><b>February 16th, 2024</b></span>

Skyline High School is located at 1122 228th Ave SE, Sammamish, WA 98075

Once you arrive at school, signs will direct you to the **theater**, where we will kick off the competition. From there, volunteers will direct all students to the classroooms where they'll be taking the test.

While we are not providing dinner (see schedule below), Skyline High School is conveniently located near many restaurants in the Sammamish area.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
